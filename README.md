# Genetic Algorithm in C++
This is a genetic algorithm I built in C++. Feel free to play around with it.

## Mutation Rate
Mutation rate defaults to 10 in a given population. Add a second integer in the constructor to change it.
If a randomly generated number from 0 to 1000 is less than the mutation rate, a mutation will occur.

## Compilation
Compilation command is `make`.
Run command is `./genetic`.
